Build in Jupyter :)

Prof Fang wants to build a robot called Chipmunk to help her predict her the number of biscuits she eats (for every cup of tea), so that she never runs out of biscuits.

We can do that in 4 steps:

1. Estimate line
2. See how far away data is to line (the error)
3. Change the line so that it’s closer to the data
4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 until the line is as close as possible.

She decides to build Chipmunk using a language called Python.


First she needs to tell Chipmunk which tools she’ll need, these are (numpy, which works with numbers), pandas (not to do with animals unfortunately, but works with data), and sklearn (which helps with teaching machines), and matplotlib (to plot graphs).

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

import sklearn

%matplotlib
(Press the arrow to get work)

x = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]
y = [3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3.5, 7.5]

(If you’d like to follow the step-by-step code you can have a look at our Jupyter notebook here, which splits Python code into very simple blocks.)
